## üìñ About

ZeroLock is designed to help you securely **store and manage your passwords** in one place.
The idea came from my own struggle ‚Äî I had multiple accounts with countless passwords, and most existing password managers in the market were **too expensive**.
So, I decided to build my own, open-source, and completely free password manager.

With ZeroLock:

* üîê All your passwords are stored securely using **Zero-Knowledge Cryptography**.
* üóù You only need to remember **one master password** to encrypt and decrypt all your saved credentials.
